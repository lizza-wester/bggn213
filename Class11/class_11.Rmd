```{r}
dp <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(dp)
sum(dp$X.ray)/sum(dp$Total)
sum(dp$EM)/sum(dp$Total)
dp$Total[1]/sum(dp$Total)
```

Do this over every method
```{r}
(colSums(dp) / sum(dp$Total)) * 100

Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
Because the resolution is too low to see hydrogen.

Q5: There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have (see note below)?
The residue number is 308.
